# Library harness

Spotify's Your Library page mocked under its own class names and accessibility identifiers (from
`trees/clean/library/03.txt`, recorded 2026-09-16), so `Redesigned/Library/LibraryHeader.x` can be laid out
and looked at on the Mac without the phone.

    THEOS=$HOME/theos ./build.sh
    xcrun simctl install <udid> build/LibraryHarness.app
    xcrun simctl launch <udid> com.vojta.libraryharness            # first look
    xcrun simctl launch <udid> com.vojta.libraryharness back       # then the pass the page gets coming back from a playlist
    xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot shot.png

`build.sh` runs `logos.pl -c generator=internal` over `LibraryHeader.x` from the checkout it sits in and
links it with the real `Core/` and `Redesigned/Kit/` sources; `SRC=<other tweak/Sources> ./build.sh` builds
an older tree instead, to compare. `stubs.m` stands in for the hook files the harness does not compile.

It plays issue #21. The page comes up with the header's control row holding Search alone. At 0.8 s the
header's model lands: Recents and Create show, and the page lays out in the same turn. The mock of
`AutoLayoutStackView` (the real one's ivars are `observationsDictionary` and `needsCoalescedLayoutUpdate`)
places what changed on the next turn of the main queue, in a pass of its own container that reaches
neither the header nor the page. So at the page's pass a button just shown still stands at the row's
origin, where 03.txt has the hidden Recents. Before the fix the moves worked out on that pass stayed:
Search ends up next to the title, left of Recents, and Create goes off the screen. A page pass later (`back`)
put Search on top of Recents, which the old code never placed. After the fix the row's own pass places
everything again.

Launch words: `back` adds the page pass at 2.4 s. `steady` builds the header with the model already in it.
`nocreate` leaves Create out of the model, and `norecents` leaves Recents out (the account the tree was
recorded on). Each moment is logged with where every control landed in the header:

    xcrun simctl spawn <udid> log show --last 1m --style compact --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[harness]" OR eventMessage CONTAINS "redesign library"'

What it does not cover: the real stack's constraints and when its coalesced update actually runs, the
element framework behind the avatar, the list's rows (`LibraryRows.x`) and the folder page.

## Compact library

    THEOS=$HOME/theos HARNESS_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/<dir> ./compact-check.sh

builds the app, runs it in a simulator of its own (made for the run, deleted after it) and exits nonzero on the
first failed check. The mock has what Compact library (`spotifyglass.redesign.library.hideChips`, `LibraryMenu.m`)
works with, under Spotify 9.1.x's identifiers: the chips as a collection view `Layout.CollectionView`
whose delegate selects and clears a filter, a clear chip whose class name holds `ClearChip`, and the list's sort row
(`YourLibraryContent.sort`, `YourLibraryContent.gridToggle`) with grid cards (`Components.UI.CardLibrary`) or rows.
The sort button cycles the order where Spotify opens its sheet; the toggle switches the view.

`check` launches (main.m) assert: off, the header is Spotify's and has no menu; on, the chips fold once the sort row
has been seen (`late`: the list loads after the page, on its own pass), the header shrinks to its row, the list's inset
drops by the chips' band and holds through Spotify's next pass; the row reads title, menu button, controls, avatar
from the leading edge, each starting where the one before ends and the avatar 8pt from the trailing edge, mirrored
right to left, the menu with its VoiceOver label, hint and large content; the menu reads `Sort (Recents) | List,
Grid*`. Sorted on the mock's own row and the row then scrolled away, the menu names no order rather than the old one;
Sort picked then scrolls the list to its top in sight, fires the row's control only once it is there, and the list is
still at its top after the reload the sort makes; with the row on screen Sort fires in place, the list left where it
is; a view already shown fires nothing; a filter on keeps the chips folded and Clear all filters clears it through
the delegate; a list with no sort row (`nosort`) and a sort row gone when fired give the chips back; a folder keeps its
chips. `noclear` chooses a filter with no clear chip the menu knows in the chips alone, with no pass of the page's:
the chips come back on the chips' own pass, fold again when it is cleared there, and with no pass at all are back by
the time the menu opens. The same run at the largest accessibility text size and right to left, then `settings`
(settings-check.m: the Library page's preview reads the chips or the menu with the switch, its title and sort rows
read from the leading edge, the switch stores the key, the card grows with the text) left to right and right to
left, and `look`, the menu opened by a finger (`../tabbar/touch.m`), screenshotted with simctl. PNGs are in
`$HARNESS_BUILD_DIR/png`.

What it does not cover: Spotify's real chips, sort sheet and list, whose identifiers and class names come from
static reading rather than a recorded tree; whether the real list's content size changes once its rows arrive (the
hook that has the page look again); and where Spotify draws a selected chip (a selected trait or a selected control).
