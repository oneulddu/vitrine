# Host check of the parts of Shared/Keyboard that need no app: the volume's 16-step grid (snap, one step a press,
# clamped to 0–100%), the command table with its inputs, modifiers and titles, and the two readings the commands are
# gated on, over described screen trees and window lists (which screen is front, what covers the app window). The
# production sources are compiled as they are; nothing here hooks UIKit or needs a simulator.
