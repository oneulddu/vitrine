# Player harness

## Upcoming-track parsing without a simulator

Run `sh harness/player/upcoming-tracks-check.sh` from the repository root. It extracts
`SGURIString` and `SGPlayerUpcomingTracks` directly from the current `PlayerState.x` and
compiles them as plain Objective-C against Foundation and minimal Spotify data doubles.
The Logos observer hooks and UIKit are not compiled. Checks cover malformed state/future
values, track filtering, URI forms (including empty strings), ordering, duplicates, the
50-row early stop and an unlimited list. Temporary outputs are removed on exit.

## Repeat transitions without a simulator

Run `sh harness/player/repeat-check.sh` from the repository root. It extracts
`SGPlayerAdvanceRepeat` from the current `PlayerState.x` and runs it against a double that records
each command in order and answers with its own token. Checks cover all four flag combinations
(off → context, context → track, track → off then context), that the track flag wins when both are
set, that the track is cleared before the context, and that the caller gets the last command's answer
(including nil for no player). Temporary outputs are removed on exit.

## Landscape title notifications without a simulator

From the repository root on an Apple Silicon Mac with Xcode and Theos:

```sh
THEOS="$HOME/theos" harness/player/title-notification-check.sh
```

`title-notification-check.sh` builds and runs a temporary, ad-hoc-signed Mac Catalyst app.
It compiles the **complete current `PlayerLandscape.x`** through Logos, plus the production
`SGMarqueeLabel` and design tokens/animation helpers. It creates the real
`SGRLandscapeLyricsController`, runs `viewDidLoad`, and posts both title notifications through
`NSNotificationCenter`; it does not extract helper bodies or call title handlers directly.
`SRC=/path/to/tweak/Sources` can select another source checkout. Build files are removed on exit;
a compile/runtime/assertion failure exits nonzero, and an in-app 15-second watchdog bounds execution.

The offline stubs provide player state with weak observers, cached title/artist answers,
artwork and karaoke views. `SGRedesignedUI()` is false only to skip automatic device-orientation
setup in the file's constructor; the controller's own notification registrations execute unchanged.
The title engine, lyric sources, AI providers, credentials and network clients are not linked.
No simulator is started. This focused check is independent of `build.sh` and its older missing
AI/lyrics symbols; it does not repair or validate the full simulator harness.

The 69 assertions cover original metadata, asynchronous current-track title and artist updates
(including accessibility labels), no update before notification, exactly one provider read per
matching event, irrelevant/malformed events, an old track's delayed completion after a track switch,
NSURL and NSString track identities, settings disable/re-enable, paused playback, local/episode/invalid
URIs, and no player state. Before and after events, snapshots compare the rest timer's identity,
validity and deadline, shield attachment, control/title/artist/stage alpha, gesture enablement,
lyrics extras, bare layout, playback state, play glyph/label, background motion and app idle state.
Forwarding spies also detect calls to `restartRest`, `setControlsShown:` and `setIdleTimerDisabled:`.
Object ivars are read directly: KVC's `rest` would invoke the production hide action, and `title`
would resolve `UIViewController.title` instead of the marquee. Finally, weak references prove the
controller and label deallocate, the scheduled timer is invalidated, and both notifications after
deallocation cause no refresh or crash.

Verified 2026-10-15: **69/69 passed**, exit 0. This checks title notification behavior on Catalyst,
not phone layout/rotation or translation-provider correctness; the separate translation suite is
not rerun here.

## Simulator harness

Spotify's full screen player mocked under its own class names and accessibility identifiers
(from `trees/clean/player/01.txt`), so the redesign's player can be laid out, animated and
looked at on the Mac without the phone.

    THEOS=$HOME/theos ./build.sh
    xcrun simctl install <udid> build/PlayerHarness.app
    SIMCTL_CHILD_HARNESS_SCENARIO=artwork xcrun simctl launch --console-pty <udid> com.vojta.playerharness
    xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot shot.png

Launch it on a simulator by UDID; it has a scene delegate (`../scene.m`), so the iOS 27 runtime runs it
too. `SRC=<another checkout>/tweak/Sources OUT=<dir> ./build.sh` builds it against other
sources, for example an older commit, to see a bug before its fix.

`build.sh` runs `logos.pl -c generator=internal` over `PlayerLyrics.x`, `PlayerArtwork.x`,
`PlayerControls.x`, `PlayerFooter.x`, `PlayerScroll.x`, `PlayerField.x`, `PlayerHeader.x` (the glass circles of
the down arrow and the ⋯, in a mocked `HeaderElementsUnit`, and their press), `DJPlayer.x` and the Kit's `SGRBridges.x`, and links them with
the real `Core/`, `Redesigned/Kit/`, `SGRKaraokeView`, `Settings/`, the Player page and the Visualizer (`PlayerVisualiser.m`, `SGRSpectrum.m`). `stubs.m` stands in for the hooks the harness
does not compile (the Kit's accent and repaint, the rest of the player, the lyrics store, the haptics,
Sing's mic) and plays a mock player: `SGRHarnessSetTrack` reports a track, with the image ids Spotify's
metadata carries, to every state observer. A song of ten timed lines plays on from launch. `main.m` also answers
for i.scdn.co through an `NSURLProtocol` handed to every session, so each picture the Kit fetches can
come late, out of order, or not at all.

`HARNESS_SCENARIO` picks what the harness does:

- `lyrics` (default) opens the lyrics at 2 s, closes them at 6 and opens them again at 10.
- `look` plays one track, then a track from another album at 8 s, whose picture reaches the screens
  0.4 s later. It shows the field, the moving background and its crossfade, and the footer row. At 3 s
  it logs whether touches on the lowered footer row (issue #54) still reach it.
- `artwork` is issue #58. Tracks change while the covers on screen lag behind (3.5 s late, past the
  Kit's last look), two skips come in a row with the older picture answering last, and one track plays
  offline. Each step checks by color that the Kit and the field show that track's picture, and the log
  ends with `artwork checks: n of 4 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`. Before the fix it read 1 of 4.
- `landscape` turns the lyrics sideways at 3 s, puts a line's meanings over them (the real
  `MeaningSheet.m`) at 4 s and takes them away at 9, then pauses at 14.5 and resumes at 15.5. Each step
  logs whether the controls are up and whether a touch on the lines lands on the lines or on the shield
  that brings the controls back, with `ok` or `WRONG`. At 6 s it logs the sheet's frame: a card inside
  the safe area with a grabber, where the sheet before it covered the whole screen. It also logs that the
  window comes up clear and fades in, dark, that every button has a label and 44pt, and at 22 s that
  VoiceOver's escape takes the screen away and gives the key back to the player.
- `scroll` moves the list up and down in code and logs whether it stayed at its top, then scrubs a mock of
  the progress bar's slider in code (issue #172): the list's pan off while it tracks, back at its end, at a
  cancel and when the slider leaves the window, and a pan that was off already left off. The log ends
  with `scrub checks: ... -- PASS` or `FAIL`.
- `controls` checks the shared ordinary/DJ glyph helpers: owner/key identity, centering and the DJ offset,
  autoresizing, front ordering and reparenting. It exits with the result, as does `scroll`.
- `cover` is issue #77. The cover is checked untouched first, then given Spotify's layout for a track with
  lyrics, a smaller cover over the lyric preview, and must take its room back as a centered square the
  Kit also reports. The log ends with `cover checks: n of 4 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.
- `immersive` opens the lyrics and waits past the rest: only the bottom stack under the title row
  (progress bar, buttons, volume row, footer) fades, the lines grow down only, a touch where the buttons
  were lands on the lines, the thumbnail takes its own, and the lines' tap is off. Then the tap that
  wakes them (fired in code), a scroll that hides them again and the thumbnail closing the lyrics. Then,
  opened again, a sheet over the player keeps the controls up past the rest and they fade once it has
  gone, Sing's mic stays with the lines and takes its own touch, and a finger held on the player (its
  touch watcher driven in code) keeps the controls up until it lifts. The log ends with
  `immersive checks: n of 15 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.
- `badge` shows the hold's 2× badge on the cover by hand, holds again while it fades out and lets go.
  The log ends with `badge checks: n of 3 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.

- `motion` is Animated artwork. The clip, `HARNESS_CANVAS_FILE` (any mp4, `harness/fluid-clip` writes one),
  is served as the track's Canvas before the player's background has laid out; then the background lays
  out, the lyrics open and close, the background is built again, and the ⋯ menu's switch goes off, on, and
  off with the player out of its window. Each step is checked (the clip on the field, the cover hidden, the
  poster under the video and the Fluid field held under it, the foot and the blur, the thumbnail, the clip
  and the cover crossing over half way through the switch). Then the song pauses and plays (the clip's rate
  0, then 1), a mock of Spotify's video unit attaches and detaches its video (the clip goes and comes back),
  a track comes with no Canvas and then again with one (the clip comes in late), and a skip to a track whose
  clip is in the store keeps the last clip until the new one is over it, the cover hidden throughout. The clip's
  dim is checked over the clip and 0.15 darker under the lyrics, with the rule at its ends; `HARNESS_DIM` is the
  dim the clip should get (`ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "color=c=white:s=360x640:d=4"` gives 0.54, black 0.10). Uninstall
  the app between clips, or the store answers with the last one. Then Low Power Mode, which the process is made
  to report (the simulator has none; Reduce Motion takes the same path), takes the clip away for the cover over
  Fluid and gives it back once off, and a track change with the app made to report the background takes the clip
  away at once, with no fade. The foot checks retain the seam-to-bottom geometry and require an opaque
  fill. A synthetic poster with green above its last 3% of rows and equal red/blue halves in those rows
  checks that the real motion view renders a uniform purple foot (RGBA 128,0,128,255), not stretched
  columns. `PlayerMotion.x` deliberately averages those rows to avoid vertical streaks (issue #40);
  requiring cropped image contents on the foot was a stale expectation.
  The log ends with `motion checks: n of 26 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.
  `HARNESS_CANVAS_FAILS=n` fails the first n requests for the clip on the way: with 1 the store tries again and
  every check passes, with 2 the clip never comes.
- `catalog` is Apple Music's catalog (`SGMotionCatalog.m`) behind a stub of its search: the names searched
  without their edition, an album search for "Midnights (3am Edition)" asking "Taylor Swift Midnights" and taking
  the edition of that same name before the standard album, then a 429 and the next album finding nothing at once
  with nothing asked. The log ends with `catalog checks: n of 5 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.

- `settings` opens the redesign's Player page (`PlayerSettings.m`, with the real `Settings/` framework) over the
  player at 3 s, with the clip of `motion` in. It checks the card leads the page with the five backgrounds'
  segmented control under it, every name whole, the Mini player section's three rows are on the page, and then,
  as the control picks each in turn, that the card shows Animated (the clip, the sources and Low Data Mode's rows
  in), Fluid, Colors, Still, Visualizer (the hills over Fluid held still) and Animated again, with a note for
  each and the header the same height throughout. The log ends with `settings checks: n of 8 right -- PASS` or
  `FAIL`.
- `preview` opens the Player page with the background Still at launch, so the player looks up no clip, and picks
  Animated on it. The card looks the track's clip up itself: nothing is asked for before the page or while Still
  shows, the card is Fluid while the clip comes (`HARNESS_CANVAS_DELAY`, 2 s), then the clip is in it with its
  poster and the field held, the player still without one, and the file in the store, where `SGMotionFile` finds
  it without asking the server again. Fluid and then Animated again bring it back at once. The clip's address is
  the run's own, so the store never has it from a run before. The log ends with
  `preview checks: n of 7 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`; on the sources before the fix it read 5 of 7.
- `card` plays nothing and opens the Player page at 1 s, then logs the card's title, artist and cover size: with
  no track ever played, Not Playing over the accent's gradient; with `HARNESS_LAST=1`, a last track played with a
  long title (gliding), its cover from the picture server and a Canvas of the run's own (`HARNESS_CANVAS_FILE`).
  `HARNESS_BACKGROUND` is the background's index, Fluid if unset. For screenshots: 2026-10-06 on an iPhone 17 Pro,
  iOS 27.0, the card read Not Playing over a dim green field, and Holocene with its cover over Fluid.
- `visualiser` plays the Visualizer background, fed by `stubs.m`'s stand-in for the audio effects' reader: a song
  of its own at 120 beats a minute, handed over in buffers of 1024 at 48 kHz. It checks the hills stand on the
  Fluid field held still with the reader on and the link at up to 60 fps, blur behind the lyrics with the link at
  30, settle and stop with the reader off on a pause, come back on play, and go and come back through the ⋯
  menu's switch to Fluid and back. The log ends with `visualizer checks: n of 7 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.

- `header` is the glass circles' press (`PlayerHeader.x`): a finger (`../tabbar/touch.m`) held half a second on
  the down arrow and then on the ⋯, each a `UIControl` under Spotify's identifier. It checks each has a 44pt glass
  circle first among its subviews, that a touch at its middle lands on the button, that the circle is pressed
  in (scale 0.92) while the finger is down and whole again once it lifts. The log ends with
  `header checks: n of 9 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`. The ⋯'s press on the phone comes through the mod's button
  over it, which this harness does not build; `harness/system-menu`'s `arrow` run covers that button's events.

- `seek` is the tap around the progress bar (`PlayerControls.x`): a mock slider with Spotify's identifier and
  the two times beside it. It checks that a tap counts below the bar and up to 12 pt past its ends, not on the
  thumb or the times, that the ends of the thumb's travel are the song's start and end, that a tap is played
  to the slider as touch down, value changed and touch up with the slider still tracking, that a drag nobody
  seeks for is seeked directly after a second, and that the slider lets go once the position is there. The
  log ends with `seek checks: n of 9 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.

- `options` is the Player page's look switches and Fluid's Grain (`PlayerHeader.x`, `PlayerFooter.x`, `DJPlayer.x`,
  `PlayerSettings.m`, `SGRFluid.m`, `SGRFluidGPU.m`). It builds a mock of the AI DJ's header and footer units too (their
  mangled `Endless_DJMusicImpl` names) and the queue's `SPTEncoreIconView`, starts with Fluid drawn Smooth and every
  switch at its standard, and leaves layout to UIKit (no once-a-second pass), so a switch has to reach the open player
  by itself. It checks the glass circles in both headers and the Music app's Connect and queue glyphs over Spotify's;
  then, with the Player page over the player, flips Header glass and Music app icons off through their switches and
  checks the circles gone with the buttons' touches, grabber and accessibility kept, Spotify's own Connect glyphs and
  the queue's own colors back, and a new device glyph Spotify draws while off left alone; then both on again. Grain's
  row shows only while Smooth draws. Then what Spotify sets while the stand-ins show comes back exactly when they go:
  Connect cleared to nil and handed an image with no bitmap, the queue's two colors reset to nil, and a value set while
  they were out is not replaced by the record from the time before. With the song paused it reads the field's top band
  at Grain 0, 100 and 200 on Smooth (more grain each time, a visible one at 200) and on Light at 100, a second after
  the switch from Smooth, then 0 and 200 (all three the same pixels). The steps run one after another, each its delay
  after the last one ran: scheduled all at once from launch, `dispatch_after`'s leeway let two fire together with no
  layout pass between. Each state a screenshot is asked for (`options: screenshot <name> now`) holds two seconds or
  more. The log ends with `options checks: n of 16 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`, and the app exits with it.
- `renderer` is the switch from Smooth to Light on its own, five times with the song paused: the field read about 0.2,
  0.5, 1 and 2 s after it (each read's own time logged, with whether Smooth shows, the Metal layers in the field and
  the Light copies hidden), compared with the band read about 4 s after; the read a second after must match it. It
  uses only Kit API the committed renderer has too, so it also runs with HEAD's `SGRFluid.m` and `SGRFluidGPU.m` copied
  into a source tree (`SRC=`). The log ends with `renderer checks: n of 5 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`.

- `automix` is AutoMix's transitions in the player (`PlayerMix.x`, with `PlayerControls.x`, `PlayerQueue.m` and
  `PlayerArtwork.x`) and the AutoMix page's preview card (`Shared/AutoMix/AutoMixSettings.m`, `AutoMixPreview.m`), in
  `automix-scenario.m`. `stubs-automix.m` stands in for AutoMix's facts (the scenario makes them and posts their
  notification) and Spotify's three playback settings (posting their change as AutoMix.x's setter hooks do) and the
  upcoming tracks; the player's position runs on the clock.
  It checks the progress bar's bands on a mock of Spotify's slider (a known window from the knob at its start to the
  bar's end and behind every part of the slider, flat at the track's thickness in a faint white and rounded only at
  the bar's own end, unchanged by a seek, nothing for unknown times, an inverted window or no facts, the next song's
  incoming window after a blend and gone once passed, none after a skip), Playing Next's line over its first row
  (each kind's text and what VoiceOver reads, the secondary label's white at the regular footnote size, a change of
  facts that makes no row again, another pair, no facts, the option off, a row's tap still skipping), the page's card
  (off with a gray divider, beat-matched with its corners on the beats and rounded, crossfade at 1, 12 and 5 s with
  equal fades, changed while away and in Spotify's page while it shows with no facts changing, its rows, no setting
  written) and the stage over the cover (held back with the option off, its start, an edgeless cross-dissolve, done as
  the window ends, handed back on a seek back, the player hidden, faded or moved off screen, a new next song, facts
  whose times are no longer known or gone, another song, a pause and the player closing, back once it is still, the
  next song's cover held and given up 3 s after the window, held back by the lyrics, an inactive app, the wide layout,
  the player off screen, Reduce Motion, the AI DJ and unknown times, and no stage kept once the player is gone).
  `automix-check.sh` runs it in a simulator of its own (`SHOTS=<dir>` keeps the states it names); the log ends with
  `automix checks: n of n right -- PASS` or `FAIL`. `automix-mutation-check.py` breaks a rule of each area (two for
  the stage) in a copy of the sources and expects the check that guards it to say WRONG.

`stubs-tickets.m` stands in for `MotionSources.m`'s `SGMotionRequestClip` and is compiled only where the sources have
`Shared/AnimatedArtwork/SGMotionTicket.m`.

`HARNESS_VOLUME=0` leaves out the volume row that the phone has and the tree does not.

A screen recording is the way to see a move:

    xcrun simctl io <udid> recordVideo -f run.mp4      # ^C to stop
    ffmpeg -ss 7.4 -t 2.2 -i run.mp4 -vf "fps=5,scale=180:-1,tile=11x1" -frames:v 1 strip.png

It also lays every unit out once a second, which is what the transforms on Spotify's title row and the
narrowed marquee labels have to survive.

What it does not cover: the real element framework's autolayout, Spotify's own scrolled layout, the
player's open and close transition, and Spotify's real image loading.
