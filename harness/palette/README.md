# Palette check

    ./build.sh && build/palette-check

runs `Redesigned/Kit/SGRPalette.m` on the Mac (as Mac Catalyst, for UIKit): a blue cover with a pale border along
its foot, read once by its bottom edge (the player's field) and once by its main color (a playlist, album or
artist page, `mainColor`). The edge has to come out gray and the main color blue. It prints PASS or FAIL; the exit
status is the number of failures.

The backdrop check renders a scale-one opaque white 16×16 cover into a 160×400 backdrop. At rows
0, 109, 219, 220, 309 and 399, and columns 0, 79 and 159, it checks premultiplied sRGB RGBA against the
documented gradients, not a platform-specific bitmap. At pixel-center height `t = (row + 0.5) / 400`,
black dimming is `d = 0.25 + 0.30 × min(t / 0.55, 1)` and opacity is one through `t = 0.55`, then
`a = (1 - t) / 0.45`. White input therefore gives RGB `(1 - d) × a` and alpha `a`.
Each channel allows ±2/255: less than one code value for raster sampling (half a pixel on the
steeper alpha ramp is `255 / (2 × 400 × 0.45) ≈ 0.71`), plus one for 8-bit rounding/dithering.
The 400-pixel height places the gradient join on an integer pixel edge.
Changing bottom dimming from 0.55 to 0.45 moves the opaque midpoint by about 13/255, well outside
that bound, without requiring different Core Graphics versions to reproduce identical dithering.

`bash harness/palette/field-check.sh` runs the production artwork field and flow layer on Mac Catalyst
with controlled palette replies. It covers artwork arriving before Colours is selected, reusing retained
artwork after a completed mode change, late palette replies in both directions, and restoration of the
still backdrop after leaving Fluid, including repeated round trips and a late Fluid palette. The palette
service, player-transition observer and Fluid renderer are test doubles; no Spotify or GPU run is implied.
The temporary executable and its debug symbols are removed on exit.
