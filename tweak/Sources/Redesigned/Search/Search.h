// The Search redesign: Spotify's Browse page (the Search tab before anything is typed) kept, with its controllers,
// list and cards, decluttered to the categories on black and restyled from the Kit. The glass search field is the
// Navbar part's (Redesigned/Navbar/SearchField.x).
//
//     SearchSections.x  an allow list of the page's cells: the category cards stay; the watch feed carousels
//                       (Playlists you can watch, Explore episodes for you), promos and any new kind collapse, and the
//                       cards below move up by the spacing the collapsed ones leave
//     SearchPage.x      the header the way Home has it: a large title, the avatar at the trailing edge, no camera, no
//                       scrim; and the page's layout pass, which measures that spacing
//     SearchCards.x     each category card as Liquid Glass tinted by its own color, at the card radius, giving under a press
//     SearchSettings.m  the redesign's Search page, a switch for each of the three below
//
// Every hook installs only while Redesigned UI is on (SGRedesignedUI).
// Threading: main thread only.
