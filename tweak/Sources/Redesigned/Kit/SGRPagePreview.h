// A live preview at the top of the redesign's page settings in Mod Settings (Playlists, Home, Search, Albums and
// Artists): a small mock of the Spotify page those settings change, drawn in plain views over local placeholder
// art, that changes with the page's switches as they are flipped, so the page shows what the restart will bring.
//
// The mock is a stack of parts from the top of the page down, with overlays over it (a tab bar, a menu, a sheet).
// A hidden part fades where it is and the parts under it move up into its room. The card draws from the page's own
// preference readers in two steps: `state` reads them into one value, and `apply` draws that value, showing or
// hiding parts and changing whatever else follows a setting (a header's layout, a card's look). While the card is in
// a window and in sight it reads `state` again whenever the defaults change, and draws only a value unlike the last
// one drawn, with the redesign's layout motion (SGRAnimate; at once under Reduce Motion). Out of sight a change is
// only noted, and read and drawn at once when the card is back in sight (SGRPagePreviewPage tells it as the page
// scrolls). Coming into a window it draws at once, from the top of the page. Nothing runs in between: no timer, and
// no observer while it has no window.
//
// The page is taller than the card: a change to a part below the card's foot scrolls the mock to it, as does one a
// page names with -revealPart: (a part that shows or hides is followed by itself), so a switch far down the
// settings is seen too.
//
// The mock's text grows with the reader's text size up to a cap, and the card grows with it; everything a part
// lays out is in multiples of `unit`. VoiceOver reads the card as one element: the label it was made with, then
// the names (accessibilityLabel) of the parts and overlays shown, in order.
//
// SGRPagePreviewPage puts the card at the top of a page as the Lyrics page has its preview: in the table's
// header, scrolling with the rows, the page's note under it.
//
// Threading: main thread only.
