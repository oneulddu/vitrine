// The scroll veil over a page's hero, the picture across the top of the album, playlist and artist pages
// (Album/AlbumHeader.x, Playlist/PlaylistHeader.x, Artist/ArtistHeader.x): as the page scrolls up the picture blurs
// and dims into the page's color and moves up slower than the page, and pulled down past the top it zooms. With it
// the page's SGRHeaderInfo is clipped under the top bar (-[SGRHeaderInfo clipUnderTopBar]). Off unless switched on
// (SGRKeyHeroScrollVeil, read at launch); off, a hero makes no veil and draws as it always has.
//
// How far the page has scrolled, d, is measured rather than read off one scroll view: the hero's own upward
// displacement in the window since the page was last at rest, plus the page's scroll beyond it (what the list
// scrolls on once the hero has stopped moving), the scroll counted from the list's adjusted top inset.
//
// The blur is the redesign's plain Gaussian layer filter, the one the player's clip has behind the lyrics
// (Player/PlayerMotion.x), on the surface's layer (the hero's, or its square's); where the filter does not exist there is the dim alone. Every
// step draws with implicit animations off and does nothing when nothing it draws changed.
//
// Ownership: the hero that makes it; it keeps weak references to the hero, the scroll view and the info.
// Threading: main thread only.
