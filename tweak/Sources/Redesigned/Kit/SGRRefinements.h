// Two small refinements of how Spotify's own player controls draw in the redesign, each one switch, read at launch:
//
//     the player's time labels roll only the characters that changed (SGRRollingDigits.m, over SGRRestyle.m's
//     monospaced labels; PlayerControls.x marks the two labels),
//     the player's add button as a star (SGRPlainCheck.x, which owns the add button's glyph, Plain checkmark's too).
//
// The decisions are plain functions (SGRRefinements.m, Foundation only) so harness/player-refinements runs them as
// they are; the views follow them.
//
// Threading: main thread only, but for the plain functions, which are pure.
