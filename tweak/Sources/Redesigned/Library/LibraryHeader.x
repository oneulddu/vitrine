// Library redesign: the header of Your Library and of a folder inside it, the way Home and Search have theirs
// (Redesigned/Home/HomeHeader.x, Redesigned/Search/SearchPage.x). A large title at the leading edge, the avatar
// that opens the side drawer at the trailing edge, and the scrim Spotify lays behind the header gone, the soft
// scroll edge (Kit/SGREdgeEffect.x) being what keeps the header clear of the list scrolling under it.
//
// The filter chips under the row stay Spotify's, untouched. They were taken out when the redesign was first
// built and the header closed up by the 49pt they left, and sorting a library turned out to be something the
// page cannot do without (issue #20). Spotify already draws them on the system's own glass
// (Reprise_LiquidGlassKit.LiquidGlass.ChipGlassView, trees/clean/library/03.txt:1210), so they belong here as
// they are; with them back the header keeps the height Spotify gives it and the list keeps Spotify's own inset,
// and there is nothing here to resize or to hold.
//
// Unless Compact library is on (Library.h). Then the root header has a menu button before its trailing controls
// (LibraryMenu.m), and while that menu can stand in for them the chips go and the header closes up by the band
// they leave: the header is shrunk to the bottom of its control row, which hangs off the safe area and so answers
// the same on every pass, and the list's top inset is lowered by the band, taken once from the live frames and
// then held against Spotify setting it again from its own pass. When the menu can no longer stand in -- a filter
// on with no clear chip, a control it fired gone -- the chips, the header's height and the inset come back. A
// filter can change in the chips or the list alone, on passes of their own that reach neither the header nor the
// page, so a change there, and the menu opening, have the page look again at once. A folder keeps its chips and
// its own controls either way.
//
// The row reads from its leading edge, so in a right-to-left language the title is at the right, the avatar at the
// left, and the menu button on the title's side of the controls.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/library/03.txt:1159-1247): YourLibraryView holds YourLibraryContentView, the size of the
// page, and after it -- so over it -- YourLibraryHeaderView 402x159.33: LiquidGlass.GradientView (the scrim), a
// 402x48 row at {0, 62} holding an AutoLayoutStackView {8, 0} 390x48 of
// ListeningActivity_ElementsKit.AdaptiveFaceContainer (the avatar, id=Components.UI.SideDrawerButton),
// id=YourLibraryHeader.title ("Your Library", 21pt), a spacer, a hidden id=YourLibraryHeader.recents,
// id=YourLibraryHeader.search and id=YourLibraryHeader.plus; and under the row
// YourLibraryHeaderContentFiltersView {0, 110} 402x49.33, the chips. Recents is hidden on the account the tree
// is of; the header's model shows it where it says isRecentsAvailable, a clock between the spacer and Search
// (issue #21), and it goes to the trailing edge with the others. A folder (trees/continuous/1.txt:325-344)
// is the same header under YourLibrary_FolderImpl, with id=YourLibraryFolderHeader.back at the leading edge,
// its title, then contextMenu, plus and play or pause, and the chips at {0, 118}.
//
// The header neither moves nor shrinks as the list scrolls -- 03.txt, 05.txt and 06.txt hold it at
// {0, 0} 402x159.33 at three scroll positions -- so there is nothing here to follow: the row is laid out once a
// pass and stays where it is put.
//
// Each control moves by a transform rather than by a frame. Spotify's stack lays them out from constraints of
// its own on every pass, and Auto Layout sets a view's center and bounds and leaves its transform alone, so the
// move outlives the pass that made it (Search moves the Browse cells the same way). Nothing leaves the stack:
// an arranged view of Spotify's that hides traps its stack in updateConstraints (Kit/SGRRestyle.h), so what
// goes is alpha, touches and accessibility, and the title Spotify draws goes that way while ours is a subview
// of the header the stack does not arrange.
//
// A move is worked out from where the stack put the control, so it holds only until the stack puts it somewhere
// else, and the stack does that on passes of its own that reach neither the header nor the page: the header's
// model arriving after the page first laid out shows or hides a button, the title gets its text, the avatar
// its size. A button just shown stands where it stood hidden, at the row's leading edge (Recents in 03.txt),
// until the stack's next pass places it. Moves worked out on the page's pass alone were then off by however
// far each control went since -- over the title, off the screen -- until the page laid out again on the way
// back from a playlist (issue #21). So the row the controls stand in is watched too, and every pass of its own
// places them again.
