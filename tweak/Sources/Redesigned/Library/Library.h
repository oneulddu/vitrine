// The Library redesign: Spotify's Your Library kept, with its controllers, its list and its rows, decluttered
// to a library on black and restyled from the Kit.
//
//     LibraryHeader.x   the header the way Home and Search have theirs: a large title at the leading edge, the
//                       avatar at the trailing edge, Spotify's filter chips kept under the row. A folder opened
//                       from the library is the same header, its back button, its own controls and its chips
//                       kept. With Compact library on, the root's chips go and the header closes up by what they
//                       leave, while the header's menu (LibraryMenu.m) can reach what they and the list's sort
//                       row offered
//     LibraryMenu.m     Compact library's menu: Spotify's own sort, list or grid and clear-filter controls,
//                       found live and fired the way a tap fires them
//     LibraryRows.x     every row and grid card: the artwork at the Kit's radius with continuous corners, a
//                       circular one left round, and a hairline between the rows
//     LibrarySearch.x   the search inside the library: its field a glass capsule, the way the Search tab's is
//                       (Redesigned/Navbar/SearchField.x)
//     LibrarySettings.m the Library page of Mod Settings, led by a preview of the page
//
// Every hook installs only while Redesigned UI is on (SGRedesignedUI).
// Threading: main thread only.
