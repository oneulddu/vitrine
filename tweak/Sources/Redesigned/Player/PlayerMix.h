// Player redesign: AutoMix's transitions shown in the player, from the Shared facts about the coming blend

//     the progress bar  the outgoing window as a lighter band at the end of the song, and once the next song has
//                       come, its incoming window at its start until playback passes it (PlayerControls.x hands
//                       over the slider)
//     the queue         the kind of the next blend over Playing Next's first row (PlayerQueue.m)
//     the cover         both songs on one stage during the overlap, then the cover back (PlayerArtwork.x lends it)
//
// The band and the stage need the windows' times (`timesKnown`); the queue shows the kind whenever facts exist.
// Only the playing -> next pair has facts, so only the first row is annotated.
