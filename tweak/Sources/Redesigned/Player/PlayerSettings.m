// The redesign's Player page in Mod Settings (App/Pages.m opens it in place of the native look's).
//
// It leads with a miniature of the whole player, pinned over the rows: the header (the close and ⋯ glyphs, in glass
// circles while Header glass is on, the album the song is from between them), the background chosen on the page edge
// to edge, the cover, the title and the artist (gliding when too long) with the add button (a star with Star add
// button), Switch to video over them unless it is hidden, the progress with the time played and the time left, and the
// transport row with shuffle and repeat left out as their chips say, previous and next spread apart when both are, as
// in the player (PlayerControls.x). The progress is where the track was when the page appeared. With no track, the
// card shows the last one played (Shared/Player/SGLastTrack.h), its cover fetched and its Canvas looked up as the
// playing one's would be, and with none ever played, Not Playing over a gradient of the accent. About
// kPreviewExpandedHeight tall at the top of the page, it shrinks as the rows scroll up to about kPreviewCompactHeight,
// the cover moving from above the title to beside it, and the rows then scroll under it.
//
// The background is the player's own: a field of the same kind (Still, Colors, Fluid), for Animated the clip the
// player is playing (SGRPlayerMotionPreview) in place of the field, or, while the player has none, the shown track's
// clip looked up for the card while it is on screen, Fluid until it comes in and for a track with none, as in the
// player; the clip crosses over the field as it arrives, its poster first while its video decodes. And for Visualizer
// the hills over Fluid held still (SGRPlayerVisualiserPreview), moving with the song. It moves under the field's own
// conditions (in a window, Spotify in front, Reduce Motion and Low Power Mode off). Another track shown reads the
// background again, and an answer that comes for the one before is dropped. The card works only while the page is on
// screen: away, its clip and hills are taken off and nothing it asked for is shown when it comes.
//
// Under Animated a tap on the card, or on its Without a clip button, shows the song as it would be without a clip,
// what Song without a clip picks (the cover art over Fluid, the full-screen cover, or the Visualizer), and a tap again
// shows it as it is; picking a choice there shows it too. It is the card's alone: nothing is asked of the player, and
// another background ends it. Under Low Power Mode or Reduce Motion it is the cover art, as the player shows then.
//
// Under the card a segmented control picks the background, all five of them: the names are one word each, each segment
// as wide as its name, so they fit side by side at an iPhone's width, and every choice stays one tap away with the
// card showing it at once. A note under the control says what the choice does; it is given the room of the longest
// note, so the rows under it hold still as it changes.
//
// Under the header: the rows that follow the choice (Animated's sources, Song without a clip, whose choice the open
// player follows at once, SGRPlayerStillChanged and SGRPlayerAnimatedVisualiserChanged, and its Low Data Mode switch;
// Fluid's sliders and their Reset, which the card and the player follow as they move, SGRFluid.h, Grain among them
// only while Smooth draws), the Controls section, whose Header glass and Music app icons switches the open player
// follows at once (SGRPlayerLookChanged), the Mini player section (Redesigned/NowPlayingBar/NowPlayingBarSettings.m),
// then the sections either look shares, the Buttons chips among them (SGRPlayerButtonsSection).
//
