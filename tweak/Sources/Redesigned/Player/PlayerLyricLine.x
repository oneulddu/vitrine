// Player redesign: the line of the lyrics being sung, one line in the gap under the cover and over the title,
// while the lyrics are not open in the player and the track has synced lines. It is the one line a place with
// room for one shows (SGKaraokeLeadLine, as the lock screen's), at the player's position less the Lyrics page's
// Delay, the way the lyrics view reads it (SGRKaraokeView's positionMs). A tap on it opens the lyrics, as the
// footer's lyrics glyph does (SGRPlayerToggleLyrics).
//
// It is a view of the mod's in SPTNowPlayingView (NowPlayingViewController's view), placed on every layout pass
// of the player, of its cover (CoverArtTiltView, which PlayerArtwork.x sizes) and of the chips' unit, centered across the cover's width in the
// room between the cover's own frame (not its paused shrink) and Spotify's bottom stack, which starts with the
// title row. A chip over the title (Switch to video) ends that room where it starts. With less room than the
// line and a gap either side, a player wider than it is tall, or Spotify's own lyric preview under the cover,
// it is not shown. While translations are shown (below) and the track has synced lines of the line's own, the line
// takes the preview's place instead (SGRPlayerLineTakesPreview): the preview is hidden by an empty mask of the
// line's (again on every pass, as Spotify may set its own), its alpha and touches left to Spotify, the room is
// measured as if it were not there, and the line shows where it would without it. Translations switched off, or a
// track with no synced lines, give every preview hidden back as it was, and the line stands down for it again.
//
// A line too wide for the room shrinks a little, and then shows in successive portions, each of whole words: the
// line being sung's portion while it is timed by the word, else its share of the line's time (PlayerLyricFit.h).
//
// While the lyrics' menu shows translations (SGRKeyLyricsTranslation, the lyrics page's own switch), the line's
// translation (SGRPlayerLineTranslation: none, or one that only repeats the line, shows nothing) sits under it in a
// smaller, dimmer footnote with the lyrics page's translation weight and brightness, on one row that shrinks to
// SGRLyricMinScale and then truncates. It goes under the line only when the room holds both with a gap either side
// (SGRPlayerLineFitIn); else the line shows alone in today's place. The translations are the lyrics page's: on the
// same kept lines, which it translates in place, and the saved ones read onto them from disk (SGLyricsLoadTranslation,
// as the Live Activity restores them); the line never asks a translator. One saved, removed or switched on or off is
// picked up at once: the translation fades in or out and the pair settles into place (at once under Reduce Motion).
//
// It reads the line on a one-shot timer armed again after every update, aimed at the next portion or the next line,
// not a display link (a CADisplayLink capped at 60 Hz drags the player's 120 Hz transitions down), and changes only
// when the line does: the new line crosses over the old one. Seeks, rate changes, lyrics changes and coming back to
// the foreground re-aim it.
