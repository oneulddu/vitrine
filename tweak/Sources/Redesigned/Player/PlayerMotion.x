// Player redesign: Animated artwork, the track's Canvas or Apple Music's animated cover behind the player,
// the way the Music app draws it. The clip runs edge to edge from the top, sharp to near its foot, where
// it dissolves into the color of its last rows, drawn on down to the bottom of the field, so it ends in
// its own color rather than on the Fluid field. A blur comes in from the seam (from above the controls for a
// Canvas as tall as the screen) and lies under the controls; behind the lyrics the whole clip is blurred.
// The player's square cover goes while a clip plays, so a track without one keeps its cover over Fluid
// (PlayerField.x keeps the field Fluid for this choice). The player's ⋯ menu switches between Animated
// and Fluid at once (Shared/Player/SpeedPitch.h).
//
// The clip is a subview of the field, not of the background plane: the plane's layout brings the field to
// the front on every pass, and a sibling would end up under it. Each of the field's layout passes attaches
// it (SGRPlayerMotionFieldLaidOut), so a clip that came in before the player first opened, or a field
// Spotify built again, gets it.
//
// The clip holds still when the moving field does (SGRField.m): out of a window, with the app not in front,
// while the player opens or closes, and while the song is paused. Under Reduce Motion and in Low Power Mode
// no clip plays at all: the cover stays over Fluid, as for a track without one, until both are off again.
// While a clip is showing, the Fluid field under it is held still too, and once the clip has faded in it is
// hidden (the field's covered): the field's color is what shows above the clip on the pull that dismisses.
//
// The clip is dimmed by how bright it is (SGRPlayerClipDim): three of its frames are measured as it comes in,
// so a white Canvas is drawn darker than a black one and the white text over it keeps its contrast. The dim
// lies only where text does, a band under the header and from above the title down, as the Music app's does:
// over the whole clip it took up to four fifths of its light (issue #101). Behind the lyrics it covers the clip.
//
// A track that changes while the player cannot be seen (out of a window, or with the app not in front, which a
// locked phone's player is while it stays in its window) takes the last clip away at once, without a fade, so
// the last track's clip does not greet the player as it opens.
//
// The clip and the cover cross over: the clip fades in from its first frame (the poster, under the video
// until the video has decoded one) as the cover fades out, and fades out as the cover comes back. A clip
// that has drawn no frame of its own after kGiveUp seconds on screen is given up, and the cover comes back.
// On a skip the last clip stays a moment (kHandOver), so a clip already in the store (the next track's is
// fetched ahead, SGMotionFollower) crosses over it with no cover between.
//
// A clip that has drawn a frame and then has its item or its looper fail is played again from the same local
// file, the poster and the foot staying as they are, so an AVFoundation failure does not leave it frozen until
// the track changes. At most kRebuildsMost rebuilds per clip (see SGRPlayerMotionRecovery): a file that will not
// play is then given up as one that never drew, and the cover or the Fluid field comes back. Only the item's and
// the looper's own failure is watched: a clip that plays but stands still, or one that never failed, is what
// the opening count is for, and there is no timer polling its clock.
//
// Spotify's music video (Switch to video) draws in one of three of its units, each told by its video surface
// as the video comes and goes: while one shows it, the clip goes and the cover comes back, as for Fluid.
//
// A square clip (Apple Music's square animated covers, no taller than kSquareAspect) plays in the cover itself
// instead, as the Music app plays one: a subview of the cover on screen, so it takes the cover's corners, its
// paused shrink, its swipe and its hiding for the open's flown cover and the lyrics' thumbnail. The field stays
// as it is under the player, and the cover is not hidden, so the rest of the player reads it as an ordinary
// cover (SGRPlayerMotionShowing stays NO). It fades in over the cover's picture, which is its own first frame.
//
// With the full-screen cover on (SGRKeyPlayerAnimatedStill, off until switched on), a track whose walk found no clip
// shows its cover the way a clip is shown, as a still: the same view (its foot, the blur under the controls, the dim
// and the lyrics' blur), at least kStillLeastAspect tall, so a square cover fills the top of the screen cut at its
// sides, with a scrim of its own under the status bar and the header's controls (kStillScrimTop). The cover is the Kit's for the playing track (SGRNowPlayingArtwork), nothing fetched for it, and only one at
// least kStillLeastPixels wide: a smaller one (the now playing bar's) leaves the ordinary cover until a larger one is
// published, which then comes in. It is held off where a clip would be (not Animated, Spotify's video, Reduce Motion,
// Low Power Mode), a clip found later replaces it, and a skip lets it go as it does a clip.
//
// With the Visualizer without a clip on (SGRKeyPlayerAnimatedVisualiser, off until switched on, and off while the
// full-screen cover is on), the same walk's finding no clip puts the Visualizer on the field in the cover's place
// (SGRPlayerVisualiserFallbackWanted, taken up by PlayerVisualiser.m). Nothing shows while the lookup is out, and a
// clip found later or a skip takes it down.
