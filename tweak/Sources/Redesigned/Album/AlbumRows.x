// Album redesign: the track rows on the field, the way the Music app has them -- no surface of their own
// and a hairline from the text's edge between one row and the next.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/album/03.txt:524-575): every row of the page is an Element_List.CollectionViewCell
// holding an Encore.ListRow, id=Components.UI.RetrievalRowElementUI, with the title
// (EncoreConsumerMobile.View.Granular.Title), the artists under it (…Granular.Subtitle) and, at the
// trailing edge, Components.UI.ContextMenuButton. A loaded 9.1.90 row carries neither Granular identifier: its
// title and artists are RetrievalRowKit's TitleView and SubtitleView (titleOf, subtitleOf). An album row carries no artwork -- every track on the
// page shares the cover the header is already showing -- so the hairline runs from the page's own margin,
// where the text starts.
//
// The row's paint is cleared here rather than left to the Kit's repaint hook, which only hears about a
// color when Spotify sets it and not when a reused cell already carries one.
//
// Spotify's type and its spacing are left alone: the row is 56pt for a title of 13pt, and a larger font of
// the Kit's would be cut off by the box the element framework measured for it.
//
// **The artist line, where it only repeats the album's.** The Music app shows a track's title alone on a
// standard album, so the line goes where AlbumCredits.m finds it says nothing the header does not. It goes by
// alpha on the Subtitle wrapper: Encore sets its inner label's alpha again later, `hidden` inside its stacks
// crashes, and the row keeps the height Spotify measured for it. The title is moved down to the middle of the
// row by a translation. The explicit badge is a sibling of the line, not inside it, so it is drawn again as a
// picture after the title's text, 4pt on, and the badge itself goes by alpha; the title is narrowed by the
// badge's room so a long one cannot run under it or under ⋯. Right to left, all of it the other way round.
// The row's own accessibility label still names the artists and says explicit; the picture is not an element.
//
// **Play counts.** A track played in Listening stats says how many times, "12 plays", in the secondary color on
// the row's middle just before ⋯, as small as the row's own type allows; none for a track never played. The
// count is the album's title and the row's title matched in the log (AlbumPlays.m), so the rows are laid out
// again when the header's title arrives and when the counts change. The title and the artist line are narrowed
// so neither runs under it. This is done before the artist line's change, which then measures the narrowed
// title, and put back after it. That is the In the row place of the Albums page's Play counts; In menu the row shows
// none, and its ⋯ tells AlbumPlaysMenu.x which track the sheet it opens is for.
//
// Everything changed is put back at the start of the cell's next pass and when the cell is prepared for reuse,
// which also asks for a pass: Spotify can show a cached row again at the same size without one, and the last
// row's state would stay on it.
//
// **⋯ in the page's colour.** The row's ⋯ (Components.UI.ContextMenuButton, its glyph the image view inside it) is drawn
// in a soft tint of the page's colour: OKLab lightness 0.80 (0.88 with Increase Contrast), the page's hue, chroma held
// to 0.08 and to what sRGB holds there. A template glyph takes it as its tint. Spotify also ships the glyph with its colour baked into the picture,
// which a tint does not reach: then a layer of the colour lies over the glyph in its superlayer, masked by the glyph's
// own picture at its scale and gravity, and an empty mask of this file's hides the glyph's own paint -- only where the
// glyph has no mask already; one someone else put there leaves the glyph alone. Unlike the rest this is kept from pass
// to pass, each property set only when it differs, and taken off (the tint and the mask put back only where they are
// still this file's) when the picture is replaced or gone, the row is laid out anywhere but an album's page, or a pass
// runs while the app is not active. The button, its action, its menu and what VoiceOver reads are Spotify's.
