// A row is a switch when it has a key, a link to another page when it has a page and a slider when it has
// a number. A flag row
// switches one of Spotify's remote-config flags: on forces it (off for a forceOff row, which is how
// a flag Spotify ships on is turned off), the switch off leaves Spotify's own value. A row
// with a value reads one out on the right and is asked again while the page is open; a page row
// with a value reads it out too, next to the chevron, and is asked when the page appears. A row
// with an action runs it when tapped.
