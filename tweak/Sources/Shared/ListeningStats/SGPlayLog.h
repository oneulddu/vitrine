// The plays Listening stats counts, kept on the phone: recorded as they happen, merged in from Spotify's own
// data export, and added up into tops, chart bars and streaks for a calendar period. The Mac harness
// (harness/listening-stats) builds the same persistence code; iOS also holds a background-task assertion.
//
// The log is a text file of one play per line, appended to as plays end, so recording costs one write:
//     end <tab> ms <tab> uri <tab> title <tab> artist <tab> album
// `end` is when the play stopped, in Unix seconds, which is what both of Spotify's export shapes record.
//
// Entry points and snapshots belong to main. Loading/imports run on a serial IO queue.
// Recorder writes append and sync in order on a separate queue, never waiting for imports or blocking main.
// The parsers are pure and run on any thread. One live writer owns a given path.
