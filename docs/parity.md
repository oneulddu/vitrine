# Parity with spoti.pw 0.50.0

Every line of upstream's 0.22.0, 0.23.0-beta and 0.50.0 release notes, and where Vitrine stands on it.
Each feature is written from its release note and public APIs, never from upstream's code after
`c790445`, which is PolyForm Strict.

Numbers are the line's position in the three release notes, in order. Status:

- **done**: built and on main. "Device" means it still needs a check on a phone inside Spotify.
- **in progress**: being built on its own branch
- **todo**: to build
- **n/a**: depends on upstream's account site, Plus or the upstream server, so Vitrine leaves it out

A completeness audit on 2026-10-05 checked every done item below against its release note. Its gaps were
fixed in the commits that follow `956e65c`.

### Beta gaps (0.23.0-beta, described by behavior)

A separate describer compared upstream's beta branch with Vitrine by behavior only (local notes, not in the
repo). Rounds 3 and 4 closed most of it: Spicy Lyrics' key, credit, pronunciations and back-off; the paused cover;
the clip's pause, Spotify's video, late Canvas, next-track fetch and give-up; the lyrics left alone; tap to seek;
the lock screen's Canvas shape, late Canvas and Canvas service; the lit custom tab; the update check; EeveeSpotify
by class; the app icon error; Signed until; two output chains; and Karaoke's memory, heat, hardware, hysteresis
and download. The rest, on `fix/beta-gaps`:

| Item | Commit |
|---|---|
| The player's clip gives way to Fluid under Reduce Motion and Low Power Mode, and goes at once when the track changes unseen | `992f379` |
| The player's clip is dimmed by its brightness, 4.5:1 (7:1 with Increase Contrast) for white text | `992f379` |
| A failed clip download is tried again once | `e0ee995` |
| Apple Music's catalog: 10 minutes alone after a 403 or 429, searched without the album's edition | `54eb39b` |
| A settings section whose rows all hide takes its heading and note; the ticker follows rows, sliders and menus | `08a9eeb` |
| Below iOS 26 the Lock screen page says Full-screen artwork needs iOS 26 | `be1a478` |
| The Mod Settings row comes back when Spotify empties its settings list or drawer | `8f9f839` |
| The install warning waits for Spotify in front; an unreadable version is not a wrong one | `e26e8a5` |
| Lyrics are looked up for the next track in the background | `28e9e2e` |
| Speed and pitch: no second mixer pull after a failed render, a silent mixer buffer zeroed | `b7bb9d7` |

Still open from the beta gaps: Fluid artwork's settings (SGRFluid.m is being changed elsewhere); the lyrics
opening for Karaoke on a song without lyrics; Karaoke's background download, output latency, interruption and
route handling, seeks and read-ahead limit (the Karaoke rewrite owns them). A change to or from Lyrics on the lock screen
now applies at once (LyricsArtwork.x), as does the star's swap. Deliberate differences: the Off default for the lock screen artwork, the lock
screen page's flag rows, the Reinvented Free player mode turned off, the title kept over the lyrics left alone.
Not gaps: Hide social proof (both flags ship off), recvmsg (Spotify 9.1.78 does not import it).

### From upstream pull requests

Rebuilt from behavior-only descriptions; each commit credits the PR's author.

| PR | Item |
|---|---|
| 165, 192 | QQ Music and KuGou lyrics sources; Thai, Lao, Burmese and Khmer lines wrap |
| 153 | Imported LRC files, a native-look lyrics page for local files, local covers |
| 179, 184 | A scrub never closes the player; lyrics left alone keep the title and scroll |
| 195 | The Live Activity ends when Spotify is swiped away |
| 200 | Music Haptics: None, Generated or Native iOS, by exact ISRC |
| 120, 99 | Accent preset menu with a swatch; custom .ttf and .otf fonts |
| 138 | The now playing bar's glass stays on the card in a Jam |
| 180, 187, 134 | Clean shared links, dead code removed, Mix row fix |

### Upstream 1.0.0-beta.1 and 0.51.0 (described by behavior)

A describer read the two release notes, the open issues and upstream's site (behavior only, no code); the notes
give no numbers, so the limits below are Vitrine's own.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| The player grows out of the mini player and follows the finger | Already done (PlayerMorph.x) |
| Square animated covers play inside the cover | Done (PlayerMotion.x); device check outstanding |
| Mod Settings searchable | Done: search on the Mod Settings page, two pages deep, read a page at a time, with keywords and recent places (SGSettingsSearch.m, SGSettingsIndex.m) |
| KuGou and QQ Music lyrics, pronunciation for most scripts | Already done (QQMusic.m, KuGou.m, Romanise.m, Pronunciation by AI) |
| Lyrics kept for offline listening | Done (LyricsStore.m): 1000 tracks, 30 MB, oldest first |
| Your own photo or pure black behind the player | Done (PlayerBackdrop.m); device check outstanding |
| An automatic accent colour, the accent following the song | Already done (Follow the cover) |
| A volume slider in the player; the DJ's redesigned player; tinted Home shortcuts | Already done |
| Album, artist and playlist pages like the Music app; more Appearance options; lock screen styles | Open: the notes and site name them without a behavior to build from |
| Web Player, Siri and Shortcuts, settings backup, Workshop, sign-in | Leave out: Plus, upstream's account or its server |

### Upstream 1.0.0-beta.4 (described by behavior)

The first batch taken from beta.4, described by behavior only and built against Vitrine's own code, and the second
round under it: per-song speed and pitch, the player's line under the cover, album notes, artist artwork, the player
refinements and the page previews.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| Lyrics pronunciation in Hangul: Japanese and Chinese lines read in Hangul, every other script in Latin | Done (Romanise.m): offline kana and pinyin to Hangul, under Pronunciation alphabet; harness/hangul-pronunciation/ |
| Teaching gestures checked against 20 seconds of ordinary movement, a threshold stored only if it never fires there | Done (HeadGesturesTeach.m, SGHeadEvaluate): the harness covers rejection, a kept previous threshold and Cancel |
| Hardware keyboard: ⌘↑ / ⌘↓ volume, ⌘1 / ⌘2 / ⌘3 Home, Search and Library, ⌘F Search with its field focused, Esc and ⌘W the player closed | Done (Shared/Keyboard, Core/SGTopController.h); harness/keyboard-commands/ and harness/keyboard-top-controller/; the keys themselves are a device check |
| Hold a lyrics line for Copy, Share and, where it has one, Meaning | Done (Redesigned/Lyrics/SGRKaraokeView.m); harness/lyrics-hold/; the press itself is a device check |
| Own lyrics as TTML, LRC or plain text, pasted too, the same 1 MB and content rules, replaced files deleted at the next launch | Done (Shared/LocalFiles/LocalLyrics.m and its page in both looks); harness/local-files/ |
| Advance work (the next track's lyrics and artwork) stands down on Low Power Mode, serious or critical heat, an unavailable network, Low Data Mode and the Load ahead switch | Done (Core/SGOptionalWork.h, asked by KaraokeSource.x's track watcher and SGMotionFollower.m's fetch ahead, both re-aimed when the up-next track changes) |
| With shuffle and repeat both hidden, previous and next move out to where the Music app keeps them | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerControls.x); a device check on a narrow and a wide iPhone is outstanding |
| Recent accent colors, up to 8, each look keeping its own | Done (Native/Appearance/AccentHistory.m, Redesigned/Kit/SGRAccentHistory.m); harness/ui-refinements/ |
| Album play counts Off, In the row or In menu, the switch it replaced migrated | Done (Redesigned/Album/AlbumPlaysPlace.m, AlbumPlaysMenu.x); harness/ui-refinements/; the sheet in Spotify itself is a device check |
| Speed, pitch, pitch-follow and reverb kept per song, and the speed menu localized | Done (Shared/Player/SpeedPitchSongs.m, SpeedPitchMenu.x, SpeedPitchEvents.h): Keep for This Song on the menu, the newest 200 records, the pre-keep values restored for every other song; harness/song-audio/ (two processes, so the relaunch is real); the menu itself is a device check |
| The line being sung under the cover: a long line shrinks and then splits into portions of whole words, read on a one-shot timer aimed at the next portion or line, and standing down where Spotify's own lyric preview shows | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerLyricFit.m, PlayerLyricLine.x); harness/player-lyric-line/ |
| Album editorial notes from Apple Music's catalog, under Play, under the tracks or off | Done (Redesigned/Album/AlbumNotes.m, AlbumSections.x; SGMotionCatalog.m's SGMotionAlbumNotesIn): exact artist, edition, count, year and rating only; harness/album-notes/ |
| Artist page: Apple Music's artist photo and animated artist artwork | Done (Redesigned/Artist/ArtistArtwork.m, ArtistHeader.x; SGMotionArtistMatch): two agreeing releases and one namesake only; harness/artist-artwork/ |
| The player's time digits rolling only the characters that changed, and the add button as a star | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRRefinements.m, SGRRollingDigits.m, SGRPlainCheck.x, PlayerControls.x, PlayerSettings.m); harness/player-refinements/ |
| A live preview at the top of the redesign's page settings, following the switches as they are flipped | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRPagePreview.m in the Playlists, Home, Search, Albums and Artists pages); harness/page-previews/ |

Judged equal, already there, or not taken, from the same beta.4 round:

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Lyric-layer ordering, the two-column lyrics and the press highlight | Already in Vitrine: the lines sung over each other are lit together and the stack moves on in order (Redesigned/Lyrics), and a press on a line opens the edit menu (harness/lyrics-hold/) |
| Glass on the full-height Queue and Connect sheets | Tried and dropped: on the iPhone 13 Pro (iOS 27.2) UIKit's `_nonLargeBackground` is nil for Spotify's sheet, so there was no material to carry to the large detent, and Spotify paints its own content opaque (#1F1F1F) there over a #1C1C1E drop shadow view; kept as a follow-up |
| A translucent download badge | Not built: the download state is not readable from Objective-C, so only a color heuristic was possible, and a wrong badge is worse than none |
| The iPad full-screen player | Not adopted: no iPad was available to verify it |

Judged not better, or not ours to take:

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Autoplay shuffle | Unsolved, and no answer of ours either: on 9.1.90 autoplay continuation reports `{autoplay}`, and despite the serialized restriction override the core answers Code=101 and leaves shuffle and repeat as Spotify set them (harness/radio-modes/README.md) |
| Rewriting an MP3's metadata tags | Left out for its data-loss risk: it edits the user's own files, and the gain is cosmetic |
| Account, Plus, server and telemetry features | Out of scope, as in Leave out: no account, no paid tier, no upstream server |

### Upstream 1.0.0-beta.4, the whole feature set (compared with Vitrine's code)

The earlier rounds took what was new in beta.4 and judged the older features from Vitrine's documentation. This round
compared the whole feature set with Vitrine's code at the logic level (upstream's side by static reading only, behavior
described and no code taken): edge cases, limits, retries, caching and where work runs.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| Artwork transfers owned by their consumers: a request hands back a ticket, a shared transfer stops when its last consumer leaves unless more than half of a known size is in, and only transient failures (timeout, lost connection, DNS, HTTP 408, 429, 5xx) are tried again | Done (Shared/AnimatedArtwork/SGMotionTicket.*, SGMotionStore.m, MotionSources.m, SGMotionCatalog.m, SGMotionFollower.m); harness/motion/ |
| A change of the up-next track re-targets the next track's artwork and lyric prefetch | Done (Shared/Player/PlayerState.x's SGPlayerUpNextIn and playerUpNextDidChange:, Shared/Lyrics/KaraokeSource.x, SGMotionFollower.m, which cancels the old target's artwork fetch) |
| Load ahead, for advance work only | Done (Core/SGOptionalWork.h, AnimatedArtworkSettings.m's SGLoadAheadRow, App/Pages.m): `spotifyglass.loadAhead`, on, on the Player page; the current track is never touched |
| Spotify's auth headers captured only from https `spclient.wg.spotify.com`, and one metadata transport for them | Done (Shared/Lyrics/KaraokeSource.x's rememberHeaders, Shared/SpotifyMetadata/): ephemeral session, no redirect, 2 MiB |
| QQ Music word timing (QRC) | Done (Shared/LyricsSources/QQMusic.m): 1 MiB bound, parsed off the main queue, plain LRC when the QRC cannot be read or a clock is malformed; harness/lyrics-sources/ |
| Lyric source matching: an artist name under four characters never matched inside another name, joined credits with aliases, a NetEase title check, JSON parsed off the main queue | Done (SongMatch.m's SGLyricsSameArtist, NetEase.m, LyricsSources.m's SGLyricsGetJSONTransform, KuGou.m, QQMusic.m); harness/lyrics-sources/ |
| Generated pronunciation as timed words anchored to source ranges, in the pronunciation role; reading segments of 4,000 UTF-16 units that never split a grapheme | Done (Shared/Lyrics/Romanise.m's SGLyricsPrepareExtras, Redesigned/Lyrics/SGRKaraokeView.m); harness/hangul-pronunciation/, harness/lyrics/ |
| Meanings matched and furigana prepared on worker queues, with bounded shared results | Done (Shared/LyricsMeanings/Meanings.m, Romanise.m, SGRKaraokeView.m) |
| Translation in the meaning sheet, on a tap | Done (Redesigned/Lyrics/MeaningSheet.m, Shared/LyricsTranslation/TextTranslation.m, ProseSegments.m): the explanation and its quote go only to the configured service, in paragraph- and sentence-bounded segments sent one after another (16 at most a tap), and a segment that fails, stops short or is cut fails the whole; harness/meaning-translate/ |
| Settings search read a page at a time, with keywords and recent places | Done (Settings/SGSettingsIndex.*, SGSettingsSearch.m, SGModPage.* searchKeywords and searchIdentifier, the main page's keywords in App/ModSettings.x and Pages.m): the six newest places under `spotifyglass.search.recents`, stored by stable setting names, never by title or text typed; harness/settings-search/ |
| Player: header glass, Fluid grain, Music app icons switches | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerHeader.x, PlayerFooter.x, DJPlayer.x, PlayerSettings.m; Kit/SGRFluid.m, SGRFluidGPU.m): `spotifyglass.redesign.player.headerGlass` (on), `spotifyglass.redesign.fluid.grain` (0 to 200 %, 100, Smooth only), `spotifyglass.redesign.player.musicIcons` (on); the open player follows them at once; harness/player/ |
| Animated artwork's clip recovery | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerMotion.x): a clip that has drawn and then fails is played again from its local file, 3 rebuilds, then given up; harness/fluid-clip/ |
| Automatic accent | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRAccent.x, SGRAccentContext.m, Player/PlayerCoverAccent.x): Accent source, `spotifyglass.redesign.accent.auto`, Picked until switched; the page in front, then the cover; recolors by token provenance, never by a similar hue; harness/appearance-accent/ |
| Explicit badge hiding, in each look | Done (Native/Appearance/ExplicitBadge.x, Redesigned/Kit/SGRExplicitBadge.x): `spotifyglass.hideExplicit` and `spotifyglass.redesign.hideExplicit`, off; a transparent mask on Spotify's own badge views; harness/ui-refinements/ |
| Separate album and playlist cover settings (the global Full bleed row removed) | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRHeaderInfo.m's SGRPageFullCover, Album/AlbumSettings.m, Playlist/PlaylistSettings.m): Cover layout, Card or Full screen, `spotifyglass.redesign.album.fullCover` and `spotifyglass.redesign.playlist.fullCover`, Full screen unless set; the old `spotifyglass.redesign.fullBleedCovers` is carried over once and kept; harness/album/, harness/page-previews/ |
| Compact library and the Library settings page | Done (Redesigned/Library/LibraryMenu.m, LibrarySettings.m, LibraryHeader.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.library.hideChips`, off; a menu of Spotify's own sort, list or grid and clear filter, the chips staying where the menu cannot reach them; a preview leads the page; harness/library/ |
| Tab bar fade switch | Done (Redesigned/Navbar/TabBar.x, NavbarSettings.m): `spotifyglass.redesign.navbar.fade`, on, with the fade in the page's preview; harness/tabbar/ |
| Spotify plays as a play count source | Done (Redesigned/Album/AlbumSpotifyCounts.*, AlbumPlaysText.m, AlbumRows.x, Shared/SpotifyMetadata/): `spotifyglass.redesign.album.playCounts.source`, Your plays unless set; one JSON GET and one batched POST per album, no automatic retry, 500 tracks an album, 64 albums and 2 MiB kept, 24 hours (five minutes after a failure); an unknown count is nothing, never 0; harness/album-counts/ |

Judged equal, already there, or not taken, from the same round:

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Search short-video carousels | Already in Vitrine: the redesign's watch feed carousels collapse with the Search page's watch feed switch (on) and come back when it is off (Redesigned/Search/SearchSections.x) |
| The iPad full-screen player and the beside-cover lyrics opt-out | Not adopted: no iPad to verify them |
| Writing an MP3's metadata tags | Left out: data loss in the user's own files |
| A translucent download badge | Not built: there is no reliable download state to read |
| Visualizer Auto and shuffle | Not taken: they cross paid-gated paths |
| Car suppression | Not taken: upstream's behavior is untraced, so there is nothing to build from |
| Glass on the full-height sheets | Unchanged from the last round (see the Queue and Connect row above) |
| Lock screen styles and the clock | Not taken: they are interleaved with Plus |
| Home snapshot replay, and the Library settings button in the header | Unresolved: upstream's behavior was not traced to the end |

Debt from this round: none left; the follow-up sweep fixed every item (ruby over wrapped compounds, the offline
store's provider translations and credits, the protobuf field budget, the previews' right to left and the Library
title row's sizes).

### Upstream 1.0.0-beta.5 (described by behavior)

What beta.5 adds over beta.4, compared with Vitrine's code and built from behavior specs only.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| The artist under the title in the minimized mini player | Done (Redesigned/NowPlayingBar/NowPlayingBar.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.inlinePlayer.artist`, off; only when both lines fit with 6 pt to spare; harness/now-playing-bar/ |
| Clear downloaded covers and artist photos | Done (Shared/AnimatedArtwork/SGMotionStore.m, SGMotionCatalog.m, AnimatedArtworkSettings.m): the store's own clips and the album answers only, leased clips kept, pre-clear work keeps and starts nothing; harness/artwork-clear/ |
| Podcasts and audiobooks hidden on Home | Done for Home's filter chips (Redesigned/Home/HomeHeader.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.home.hidePodcasts`, shown unless set; harness/home-podcasts/. Search's category cards are deferred: rewriting the two-column grid's layout attributes overlapped on scroll, so they wait for a traced data-source boundary |
| A full-screen cover when a song has no clip | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerMotion.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.player.animatedStill`, off, with a top scrim; harness/player/ `still` |
| Page headers: covers blur and dim on scroll, the title faded under the top bar, a round artist Play, Play in the accent | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRHeroVeil.m, SGRHeaderInfo.m): `spotifyglass.redesign.hero.scrollVeil` and `.artist.roundPlay`, off; `spotifyglass.redesign.playInPageColour`, on; harness/album/veil-check.sh |
| The Music app's player close | Done, off by default (Redesigned/Player/PlayerMorph.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.player.musicClose` stages the close inside 9.1.90's own CompactOverlayTransition animator (traced on a phone: tap, drag and cancel), lands on the measured mini player, shapes a release by its velocity and leaves cancellation to Spotify; an owner without those parts keeps Spotify's timing and the old path; harness/morph/check.sh |
| Ambient sounds | Not taken: the recordings come from upstream's server, and the user chose to leave the feature out |

### Upstream 1.0.0-beta.6 (described by behavior)

What beta.6 adds over beta.5, compared with Vitrine's code and built from behavior specs only. Every new switch is off.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| Album pages coloured from what the cover is, the cover sharp under the title | Done (Redesigned/Kit/SGRCoverRead.m, Album/AlbumHeader.x): Picture-aware cover, `spotifyglass.redesign.album.adaptiveCover`; harness/album/cover-check.sh |
| Artist pages coloured from the photo with faces left out | Done for the colour (Kit/SGRCoverRead.m, Artist/ArtistHeader.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.artist.adaptivePhoto`. Upstream's extension under the photo is not taken: Vitrine's photo fills the hero |
| Round artist Play with its triangle cut out, white or in the accent | Done (Kit/SGRActionRow.m, SGRHeaderInfo.m): `spotifyglass.redesign.artist.cutOutPlay`, `spotifyglass.redesign.accentPlay`; Play in the page's color is kept for every other Play; Round artist Play moved to the Artists page; harness/artist/cutout-check.sh |
| Monthly listeners in About | Done (Artist/ArtistSections.x): `spotifyglass.redesign.artist.listenersInAbout` only takes the line off the header, since Spotify's About card and page already show the count (seen on a 9.1.90 phone); harness/artist/listeners-check.py |
| A pinned whole-player preview, one Song without a clip choice, Buttons chips | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerSettings.m): over the existing keys; the preview shows the current song, not demo songs; harness/player/settings-check.sh |
| Music app icons folded into Music app style | Not taken: Vitrine keeps the two switches apart |
| Visualizer shaders, motion presets | Not taken: paid upstream |

### Upstream Plus features, Vitrine's own versions (described by behavior)

Vitrine has no paid tier, so where a Plus feature could be built from its behavior alone it now has one of its own,
with no gate and nothing from upstream's code, server or content.

| Item | Where Vitrine stands |
|---|---|
| Visualizer when there's no clip, shuffle styles, ignore heat | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerMotion.x, PlayerVisualiser.m): `spotifyglass.redesign.player.animatedVisualizer`, `spotifyglass.visualizer.shuffle`, `.ignoreHeat`, all off; the full-screen cover and the Visualizer fallback exclude each other; harness/player/ `autoviz`, `shuffle`, `heat` |
| Hold edge speed | Done (Shared/Gestures/GestureHold.m): `spotifyglass.gestures.hold`, on, and `.hold.speed`, 1.5×, 2× or 3×; the speed from before the hold comes back, not 1×; harness/gesture-hold/ |
| Lock screen lyric styles Messages and Vinyl | Done (Shared/LockScreenLyrics/SGLyricsClip.m): two more Layout choices, kept between 17% and 65% of the screen; harness/lyrics-clip/ |
| Suggested tags for local files | Done as Find Info (Shared/LocalFiles/LocalInfoLookup.m, LocalInfoReview.m): iTunes Search, reviewed field by field, saved only through Vitrine's overlay; the audio file is never written, unlike upstream's tag rewriting; harness/local-files/ |
| Effects preset per output, headphone form filter | Done (Shared/AudioEffects/AutoEq.m): a baseline stored before applying and restored only while unchanged, both directions crash-safe; harness/audio-effects/ `route`, harness/autoeq/ |
| Liveprog CPU budget | Done (Shared/AudioEffects/SGDSPEngine.m): half of real time, a click-free bypass and a quarantine, a 2 s start deadline; harness/liveprog-guard/ |
| Audio import | Done (Shared/LocalFiles/LocalAudioImport.m, LocalAudioPage.m): Player › Local files copies picked audio into Documents, which Spotify's own Local Files page scans and plays (seen on a 9.1.90 phone), never overwriting; Imported files lists and deletes only what Vitrine copied, checked by file identity, never recursively; harness/local-files/audio.m |
| Your Files page, folders, offline animated covers for local albums | Not built yet: a phone trace showed Spotify's Local Files rows start playback by a path outside SPTEsperantoPlayer's play methods, so Vitrine's own page has no proven command; moving files risks the user's data |
| AutoMix per context and its info line | Not built yet: when Spotify reads the transition preferences must be shown on a phone first; upstream's rewriting of Spotify's remote-config files is not taken |
| Poster and Cut lyric visualizers | Done (Redesigned/Player/PlayerLyricStages.m, PlayerVisualiser.m): layers and text, no Metal; the halftone made once per artwork off the main queue; parameters in `spotifyglass.visualizer.params`, rows only for the chosen style; harness/player-visualiser/ |
| Lock screen style templates with a clock, lyrics shaders | Not taken: a template language for little gain over iOS's own clock; lyrics shaders exist only as downloads from upstream |
| DSP suite, AutoEq, AutoMix styles | Already in Vitrine (Shared/AudioEffects, Shared/AutoMix) |
| Bundled DDC and EEL example files | Not taken: each file's source and license would have to be checked first |

## Still open

- Device checks: Settings, the player footer and the Lyrics Style sheet were checked on an iPhone 15 Pro
  (iOS 27) for beta.1. Still unchecked: Karaoke with a freshly downloaded model, Delay with AirPods, the Live
  Activity options and preview, the font families, Settings at the largest accessibility text size, and
  VoiceOver. Each commit body lists what to check.
- From beta.4, on a phone: the hardware keyboard's keys, holding a lyric line, the player's spacing with shuffle and
  repeat both hidden on a narrow and a wide iPhone, and an album's ⋯ sheet with Play counts In menu.
- From beta.5 and the Plus round, on a phone: every new switch above (the mini player's artist line, Clear
  Downloaded Covers, the Home chips, the full-screen cover and its scrim, the page veils and round Play, the Visualizer
  fallback and shuffle, the hold speeds, Messages and Vinyl on the lock screen, Find Info against the real iTunes
  Search, a preset following AirPods and the speaker, a runaway Liveprog script).
- From beta.6, on a phone: Picture-aware cover and photo on real albums and artists, the cut-out Play through
  Play/Pause and Increase Contrast, the listeners line on an artist with and without About, the pinned Player preview
  and its Without a clip pill.
- From the second round, on a phone: Keep for This Song across a relaunch, the line under the cover with Spotify's own
  lyric preview on, the album notes' two placements and their sheet, an artist's photo and animated artwork, and the
  rolling digits and star. The Queue and Connect sheets' glass is not checkable until UIKit hands the sheet a
  background below full height on iOS 27.
- From the whole-feature round, on a phone (iPhone 13 Pro, 9.1.90): checked are Spotify's own lyrics with the narrowed
  header capture, the new rows in Korean, settings search and its recents, the cover layouts, the tab bar fade, the
  header glass and Music app icons switched off, Automatic accent, and the next track's lyrics prepared when Up Next
  changes. Spotify plays matched the artist page's Popular counts exactly and now show in the rows. Still unchecked:
  Compact library's menu, the E masks (the album tried had Korean 19 badges), the next track's artwork, and the meaning
  sheet's Translate. The artist line's change does not reach a loaded 9.1.90 row, whose explicit badge sits inside the
  SubtitleView it would hide.
